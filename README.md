# Necropolis - City of the Dead

Created in 2000 by Mavrick Designs, "Necropolis" is a horror game based on the movie Phantasm.
It was developed in DarkBASIC and published for free on DarkBASIC Demo CDs.

In 2025, I have ported the game to DarkBASIC Professional and fixed a BUNCH of bugs and problems,
and also implemented some small improvements, such as showing the current level in the HUD.

## How to play

### Download and Installation

- Necropolis can be downloaded here: https://github.com/danielmarschall/necropolis/releases
- You need to install DirectX 9.0c. It is included in the game files of another game I have developed: https://github.com/danielmarschall/forest/archive/refs/heads/master.zip
- After this, you just need to run Necropolis.exe

### Instructions

At the first level, you need to shoot enemies until one enemy drops the key. Then you can enter the house (enter at the window shown in the intro video).

In the next levels, you need to find the key (which is always on the floor) and go through the door in the spacegate room.

Beginning with level 4, spheres will follow you. The silver spheres are slow, the golden ones are faster and the read ones are deadly and fast. Note that you can shoot them.

### Controls

- Walk with the arrow keys
- Shoot with Ctrl key
- Escape key closes the game

### Items

- Ammo
- Shield
- Life
- Key

### Radar

If you have shot 60 enemies, you receive a radar which shows everything around you, but no spheres.

At 80 enemies, the radar will also show silver and golden spheres

At 120 enemies, the radar will show everything, not just the area around you.

At 140 enemies, the radar will also show the red spheres.

At the right top you can see the amount of enemies killed. Note that the counter does not reset when you restart after dying.
